Office space for the PIs and graduate students are provided by the department and available for the expected duration of the project.  These research labs will have multiple Windows and Linux workstations available for student use for simulations and other computing needs.  Laboratory space for the proposed infrastructure will also be provided by the department for the extended lifespan of the equipment, beyond the duration of this proposal.  It is equipped with the necessary power, ethernet, air, and water ports necessary for the operation of the various equipment as well as for use by researchers working in the space.
 
 Software information and availability is detailed in the Data management plan. Additionally the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA supports education and research activities through a variety of shared computing resources for both the research and teaching activities of the Department. The School provides networking, disk storage and backup, general-purpose timesharing access to multiuser systems, email and workstation support. The School's central facility is for the support of research, and is open to undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff. The Department network is connected to the UCLA campus backbone via a gigabit connection. An 802.11n wireless network is available throughout the Department. The Department network is also linked to the School's network that includes IBM servers and workstations and PC-based labs, supporting classes and giving access to undergraduate students.
